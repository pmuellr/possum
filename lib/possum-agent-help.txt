and then connect to a possum-server via WebSocket, for use there.

  %PROGRAM% [opts] possumServerURL

`possumServerURL` is a Websocket URL to a possum server that the agent will
connect to

    -k --key [string]       the key to send when connecting to the websocket
    -8 --v8port [number]    which port to scan for the v8 debugger
    -v --verbose            generate verbose messages
    -h --help               print this help

By default, no key is sent, and the --v8port is 5858.

The --v8port option may be specified as a range.  Eg, --v8port 5858-5860 will
scan ports 5858, 5859, and 5860.
